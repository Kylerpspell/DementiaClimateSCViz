			<h3>
				Alzheimers Disease Registry:
			</h3>
			This data was collected by the Arnold School of Public Health and is the nations most comprehensive
			Registry of its kind. The data I used in my project was:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>YODX:</b> Year of diagnosis
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>DX_Age:</b> Age of diagnosis
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Dementia:</b> Type of dementia
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>zip0</b>: 5 digit zipcode
					</li>
				</ul>
			I used ~98,000 records from the registry to populate my visualizations.

			<h3>
				Climate Data:
			</h3>
			This data was collected by using the Farmers Almanac Weather History Page. I used the zipcode data
			to populate a 20 year history of climate data for each record in the database. The data I used were:

			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>High Temp:</b> The high tempurature recorded on the 15th of each month for the past 20 years. This was 
					averaged across the entire 20 year span to recieve a single value for each record.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Dewpoint:</b> The dewpoint recorded on the 15th of each month for the past 20 years. This was
					then used with the tempurature to <a href="https://bmcnoldy.rsmas.miami.edu/Humidity.html">calculate</a> the Relative Humidity day. This was then averaged across
					the entire 20 year span to recieve a single value for each record. 
				</li>
			</ul>

			This was done using a python webscraper that I wrote. In total there were ~256,000 requests made to the website and then 
			stored in a local database.

			<h3>
				US Census Data:
			</h3>
			I collected data from the US Census Bureau to get the population of each county. This data was used to 
			normalize the data for one of the visualizations.

			<h3>
				US Zipcode Data:
			</h3>
			I collected data from zip-codes.com to get the county for each zipcode. This data was used to
			generate the county data for the visualizations.
