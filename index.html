						What is Dementia?
					</h2>
					<p>
					Dementia is a group of symptoms associated with a decline in 
					cognitive function that affects memory, thinking, behavior, and 
					the ability to perform everyday activities. It is a progressive 
					condition that affects a person's ability to function independently and 
					carry out daily tasks.
					</p>

					<p>
						The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, but other 
						causes include vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal 
						dementia, and Huntington's disease. Dementia can also be caused by other
						 medical conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, brain injuries, or infections.
					</p>

					<p>
						The symptoms of dementia can vary depending on the cause and the stage of
						 the disease, but common symptoms include memory loss, difficulty with 
						 language and communication, poor judgment, disorientation, and changes in 
						 mood and behavior. As the disease progresses, a person may also experience
						 difficulty with movement and coordination, and may require assistance with 
						 activities of daily living.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our dataset is the nations most comprehensive and largest registry of its kind. It chronicals
						the progression of dementia in South Carolina going back to 1990. The data was collected by the
						Arnold School of Public Health. The goal of this project is to see if there is a correlation between
						climate and dementia. We will investigate this by looking at a series of visualizations that will
						look at the spatial distribution of dementia cases, and climate factors such as temperature and
						humidity. We will also look at the temporal distribution of dementia cases and climate factors.
