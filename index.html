						What is Dementia?
					</h2>
					<p>
					Dementia is a group of symptoms associated with a decline in 
					cognitive function that affects memory, thinking, behavior, and 
					the ability to perform everyday activities. It is a progressive 
					condition that affects a person's ability to function independently and 
					carry out daily tasks.
					</p>

					<p>
						The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, but other 
						causes include vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal 
						dementia, and Huntington's disease. Dementia can also be caused by other
						 medical conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, brain injuries, or infections.
					</p>

					<p>
						The symptoms of dementia can vary depending on the cause and the stage of
						 the disease, but common symptoms include memory loss, difficulty with 
						 language and communication, poor judgment, disorientation, and changes in 
						 mood and behavior. As the disease progresses, a person may also experience
						 difficulty with movement and coordination, and may require assistance with 
						 activities of daily living.
